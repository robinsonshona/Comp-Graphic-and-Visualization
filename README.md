How do I approach designing software? What new design skills have you work on the project helped you to craft?What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? How do I approach developing programs?
 What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? 


Usually when designing software, I start by looking at the primary objective of the project and creating a wireframe/pseudo code. The new design skills I learned through this project are primarily everything to do with 3D graphics. In the past, I have only played around with 3D art like Blendr and have never actually programmed assets. Before this course, I had no experience coding 3D assets or using OpenGL.
My process consisted of following the modules in creating each step of the 3D scene, including rendering the object, the camera, the texture, and the lighting. As I develop programs, I break them down into smaller pieces and work on each one at a time, breaking down large projects into smaller ones.
Instead of writing new code from scratch, I incorporated libraries and existing formulas into my 3D scene code.
Although it took me a long time to comprehend certain concepts, the iteration factor helped me to gain a better understanding of them and allowed me to visualize my project better. I think breaking down the project into smaller pieces helped me feel that I was progressing.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?


Computer science is integral to my goal of becoming a professional software developer specializing in full-stack web development and mobile development.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?


In terms of computational graphics and visualizations, I have a better appreciation for graphics and game engines created by engineers. I would, however, need to spend more time learning these skills and concepts to become more proficient in this field. By working with existing libraries, formulas, and code, I have learned how to use computational graphics and visualizations. I have also gained a better understanding of color, space, and graphics. Having this knowledge will help me a great deal in my professional career.
